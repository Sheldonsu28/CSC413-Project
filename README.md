# Analysis SRCNN \& ESRGAN for Image Super Resolution

In this project, we are interested in the application of deep neural networks in image super-resolution. We re-implement one discriminative method (SRCNN \cite{ct1}) and one generative method (ESRGAN \cite{ct2}). Moreover, We apply these two existing algorithms to several new image data sets and perform in-depth analysis both quantitatively and qualitatively.
